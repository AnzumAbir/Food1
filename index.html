                <p>It's filled with all the ingredients that help fight chronic disease in one delicious bowl. The
                    soluble
                    fiber in corn keeps you fuller and more satisfied, meaning you'll eat less at your next meal. The
                    potassium helps in managing blood pressure by reducing the impact of sodium in the diet.</p>

                <p>Yogurts can be high in protein, calcium, vitamins, and live culture, or probiotics, which can enhance
                    the
                    gut microbiota. These can offer protection for bones and teeth and help prevent digestive problems

                <p>Eggy Bread is savoury. French Toast is sweet. Obviously the dishes are very similar and french toast
                    can
                    be
                    made without anything sweet being added to the egg mix. But it is then generally served with syrup,
                    fruit
                    and/or whipped cream etc.</p>
